## üìù Overview

This repository aggregates essential tools and outlines a structured methodology for **cybersecurity professionals** and **security awareness trainers** to conduct legitimate, defensive phishing simulations (using frameworks like GoPhish) and perform **forensic analysis** on collected phishing samples.

The methodology focuses on understanding the attack chain from creation to analysis to build stronger organizational defenses.

## 3. üìß Tools for Email Header Analysis

Analyzing email headers is key to identifying the true sender, mail flow path, and authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).

* **MailHeader:** `https://mailheader.org/`
* **Messageheader (Google Apps Toolbox):** `https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/analyzeheader`
* **Message Header Analyzer:** `https://mha.azurewebsites.net/`

## 4. üåê Tools for IP and URL/Link Analysis

Used to gather threat intelligence and check the reputation of infrastructure used in phishing campaigns.

### **Tool for Information of IP**

* **IPinfo.io:** `https://ipinfo.io/` - Provides detailed information about an IP address, including geolocation, host, and network owner.

### **Tools for URL/Link Analysis**

* **URLScan.io:** `https://urlscan.io/` - Scans and analyzes websites, providing screenshots, DOM, and network requests.
* **URL2PNG:** `https://www.url2png.com/` - Captures a screenshot of a webpage. (Useful for visual verification without direct browsing.)
* **Wannabrowser:** `https://www.wannabrowser.net/` - Safely renders URLs to check their content.
* **Talos Reputation Center:** `https://talosintelligence.com/reputation` - Checks the reputation of IPs and domains based on Cisco Talos intelligence.

## üî¨ Phishing Analysis Methodology: 5 Phases

The following steps outline a standard procedure for conducting a defensive phishing exercise and performing incident response on a collected sample.

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Planning & Sample Collection

* **Define Objectives:** Clearly state what is being tested (e.g., sender spoofing, malicious links, attachments) and the success metrics.
* **Sample Collection:** Collect representative raw phishing samples (e.g., as `.eml` files) for forensic examination.

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Phish Creation (Gophish)

* **Build Components:** Use **GoPhish** to create realistic, controlled phishing emails and landing pages.
* **Simulation Setup:** Configure the platform to simulate email delivery, track user clicks, and capture credentials or payload behavior for analysis.

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Delivery & Testing

* **Execution:** Send the controlled phishing campaign to designated test accounts.
* **Monitoring:** Monitor delivery results and ensure the raw email files are saved for subsequent steps.

### Phase 4 ‚Äî Header & Sender Analysis

* **Forensics:** Analyze the raw email headers and sender metadata, focusing on the `Return-Path`, `Received` chain, and email authentication results (SPF/DKIM/DMARC).
* **Tools:** Utilize **Google‚Äôs Message Header Analyzer** and **PhishTool** for detailed message forensics and visualization.

### Phase 5 ‚Äî Link & URL Scanning

* **Extraction:** Extract and inspect all links and attachments from the collected samples.
* **Reputation Check:** Scan all suspicious URLs, files, and domains using **VirusTotal** and **URLScan.io** to check for known malicious reputations and analyze payload activity.
